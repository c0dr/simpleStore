This project is a small attempt to create a serverless Stripe store with React and NodeJS.

Features:
* load product data based on SKU from Stripe
* Use the PaymentRequest API if available, otherwise fallback to regular form-based checkout 
* uses Stripe Elements

It was thrown together on a Sunday afternoon as an attempt to create a MVP with not a lot of error handling. Not production-ready or beautiful by any means.
